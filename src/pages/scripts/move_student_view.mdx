# Move student view

<DownloadButton url={import.meta.env.BASE_URL + "/scripts/tm_move_student_view.zip"} />

<hr />

In some cases the bottom bar indicating you are in student view in Canvas may block something important, like shown below.

<Figure src={import.meta.env.BASE_URL + "/images/move_student_view.png"} alt="Screenshot of student view bar blocking the lower part of the screen." cap="Screenshot showing how the student view bar can block the lower part of the screen in Canvas." />

The button with the double arrows have been added to move the bar to the top of the screen or back to the bottom.

NOTE! The position will not persist. Refreshing the page, or exiting and entering student view again will return it to the bottom.
