# Find Smartdesigner Color Palette
<DownloadButton url={import.meta.env.BASE_URL + "/scripts/tm_smartdesigner_color_palette.zip"}></DownloadButton>

<hr/>

Add a button to the top right of a course home page (see screenshot below). The text "Smartdesigner Fargepaletter" means "Smartdesigner Color Palettes".

<Figure src={import.meta.env.BASE_URL + "/images/sd_color_palette_button.png"} alt="Screenshot of the button that is used to find color palettes." cap="Button that is used to find color palettes." />

Clicking the button will open a modal window where you can start the audit. It will show the progression of the audit with the following symbols:
