# Page Numbering Smartdesigner

<DownloadButton url={import.meta.env.BASE_URL + "/scripts/page_numbering_in_canvas.zip"} />

<hr />

This script adds buttons that allow you to insert page numbers into specific headers created with Smartdesigner. The buttons are labeled in Norwegian: "Legg til sidetall" to add page numbers, and "Fjern sidetall" to remove them.

<Figure src={import.meta.env.BASE_URL + "/images/add_page_buttons.png"} alt="Screenshot of the buttons that let you add and remove page numbers." cap="Screenshot of the buttons that let you add and remove page numbers." />

When you run the "add page numbers" function with existing page numbers, it will update the current values to reflect any changes. The page numbers will be formatted as “Side x av y,” where x is the current page and y is the total number of pages (entries) in the module. Only pages (with the right headers) will display page numbers.
