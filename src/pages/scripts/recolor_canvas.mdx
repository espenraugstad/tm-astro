# Recolor Canvas

<hr/>
This script adds a toolbar above a page title in Canvas, as seen in the image below.

<Figure src={import.meta.env.BASE_URL + "/images/recolor.png"} alt="Screenshot of the recoloring toolbar" cap="The toolbar with some colors that can be changed." />

Choose a new color from either color picker to see the changes on the page. Click the reset button (or reload the page) to set all colors back to the way they were.

__Note!__ 

This tool does not work on every color. It is primarily intended to be used for elements that have hardcoded, inline, CSS colors defined. It does not work with colors that are defined as variables.

It targets text color, background color, and border color (each side separately).
